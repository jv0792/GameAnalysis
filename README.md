#Description to Business Problem:#
A gaming company wants to optimize its global sales strategy to maximize revenue and market penetration. The company has a dataset containing information about various games, including their platform, year of release, genre, publisher, and sales figures across different regions (North America, Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world).

The company needs to identify key trends and insights from the data to develop a robust global sales strategy. This includes understanding which platforms and genres are most popular in different regions, identifying the most successful publishers, and determining how sales performance varies across different years.

#What I Did:#

Understanding the Stakeholder Requirement.
 
Data Import and Transformation: Imported a flat file (.csv) into Power BI for comprehensive data analysis.
Performed various transformations including, adjusting data types of columns, rectifying error values within the year column, renaming columns for clarity. Integrated a 'Date' table to enable Time Intelligence functions.
 
Data Modeling: Utilized Power Query Editor to refine and transform the data.
Established a flat schema data model in Power BI, setting cardinality as many-to-one for relevant tables.

Metric Creation: Developed key measures including, 'Sales PY' - Sales for the previous year; 'YTD Growth' and 'YTD Growth%' - Year-to-Date growth; 'MoM Growth' - Month-to-Month growth. 'QoQ Growth' - Quarter-to-Quarter growth.

Report Creation:
Designed various reports to visualize and present the data effectively.
